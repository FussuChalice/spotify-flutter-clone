## What is Spotify?

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that offers access to millions of songs and content created by artists worldwide. Enjoy basic features like playing music for free, or choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium.

With or without Premium, you can:

- Receive personalized music recommendations based on your taste.
- Curate collections of your favorite music and podcasts.
- And much more!

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed (version `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`).
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Get all project dependencies
flutter pub get
```

Use the [replace_to_spotify_keys.sh](replace_to_spotify_keys.sh) script to replace <your client id> and <your client secret> with your [Spotify Developer Keys](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). You can obtain your Spotify Keys from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
